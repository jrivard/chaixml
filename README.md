# XMLChai
XML Chai is a wrapper for Java's built-in w3c XML Library with simplified and modern API.  

XML Chai API has the following properties:

* Thread safe access to entire API
* Immutable mode to guarantee read-only document access
* Modern (JDK8+), simple API for common DOM functions without ceremony
* Wraps the JDK supplied w3c DOM library for correctness, efficiency and availability.

What XML Chai is not good at:

* Advanced/Complete XML feature access
* Performance efficiencies available when working directly with w3c API
*
